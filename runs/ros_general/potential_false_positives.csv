Equivariant Filter Design for Range-only SLAM,"Range-only Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (RO-SLAM) is of interest due
to its practical applications in ultra-wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) localisation in terrestrial and aerial applications and acoustic beacon
localisation in submarine applications. In this work, we consider a mobile
robot equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a range sensor that
measures distances to a collection of fixed landmarks. We derive an equivariant
filter (EqF) for the RO-SLAM problem based on a symmetry Lie group that is
compatible with the range measurements. The proposed filter does not require
bootstrapping or initialisation of landmark positions, and demonstrates
robustness to the no-prior situation. The filter is demonstrated on a
real-world dataset, and it is shown to significantly outperform a
state-of-the-art EKF alternative in terms of both accuracy and robustness.","Yixiao Ge, Arthur Pearce, Pieter van Goor, Robert Mahony",2025-03-05T23:48:32Z,2025-03-05T23:48:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03973v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:mobile AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
SODA: a Soft Origami Dynamic utensil for Assisted feeding,"SODA aims to revolutionize assistive feeding systems by designing a
multi-purpose utensil using origami-inspired artificial muscles. Traditional
utensils, such as forks and spoons,are hard and stiff, causing discomfort and
fear among users, especially when operated by autonomous robotic arms.
Additionally, these systems require frequent utensil changes to handle
different food types. Our innovative utensil design addresses these issues by
offering a versatile, adaptive solution that can seamlessly transition between
gripping and scooping various foods without the need for manual intervention.
Utilizing the flexibility and strength of origami-inspired artificial muscles,
the utensil ensures safe and comfortable interactions, enhancing user
experience and efficiency. This approach not only simplifies the feeding
process but also promotes greater independence for individuals with limited
mobility, contributing to the advancement of soft robotics in healthcare
applications.","Yuxin Ray Song, Shufan Wang",2024-10-25T13:42:03Z,2024-10-25T13:42:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19558v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19558v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:mobile AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
A Soft Robotic Exosuit For Knee Extension Using Hyper-Bending Actuators,"Movement disorders impact muscle strength and mobility, and despite
therapeutic efforts, many people with movement disorders have challenges
functioning independently. Soft wearable robots, or exosuits, offer a promising
solution for continuous daily support, however, commercially viable devices are
not widely available. Here, we introduce a design framework for lower limb
exosuits centered on a soft pneumatically driven fabric-based actuator. Our
design consists of a novel multi-material textile sleeve that incorporates
braided mesh and knit-elastic materials to realize hyper-bending actuators. The
actuators incorporate 3D-printed self-sealing end caps that are attached to a
semi-rigid human-robot interface to secure them to the body. We will
demonstrate the effectiveness of our exosuit in generating enough force to
assist during sit-to-stand transitions.","Tuo Liu, Jonathan Realmuto",2024-09-19T00:12:29Z,2024-09-19T00:12:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02802v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02802v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:mobile AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024

A Mini-Review on Mobile Manipulators with Variable Autonomy,"This paper presents a mini-review of the current state of research in mobile
manipulators with variable levels of autonomy, emphasizing their associated
challenges and application environments. The need for mobile manipulators in
different environments is evident due to the unique challenges and risks each
presents. Many systems deployed in these environments are not fully autonomous,
requiring human-robot teaming to ensure safe and reliable operations under
uncertainties. Through this analysis, we identify gaps and challenges in the
literature on Variable Autonomy, including cognitive workload and communication
delays, and propose future directions, including whole-body Variable Autonomy
for mobile manipulators, virtual reality frameworks, and large language models
to reduce operators' complexity and cognitive load in some challenging and

"Person Transfer in the Field: Examining Real World Sequential
  Human-Robot Interaction Between Two Robots","With more robots being deployed in the world, users will likely interact with
multiple robots sequentially when receiving services. In this paper, we
describe an exploratory field study in which unsuspecting participants
experienced a ``person transfer'' -- a scenario in which they first interacted
with one stationary robot before another mobile robot joined to complete the
interaction. In our 7-hour study spanning 4 days, we recorded 18 instances of
person transfers with 40+ individuals. We also interviewed 11 participants
after the interaction to further understand their experience. We used the
recorded video and interview data to extract interesting insights about
in-the-field sequential human-robot interaction, such as mobile robot
handovers, trust in person transfer, and the importance of the robots'
positions. Our findings expose pitfalls and present important factors to
consider when designing sequential human-robot interaction.","Xiang Zhi Tan, Elizabeth J.

"Localization and Perception for Control of a Low Speed Autonomous
  Shuttle in a Campus Pilot Deployment","Future SAE Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous vehicles will require novel
applications of localization, perception, control and artificial intelligence
technology in order to offer innovative and disruptive solutions to current
mobility problems. Accurate localization is essential for self driving vehicle
navigation in GPS inaccessible environments. This thesis concentrates on low
speed autonomous shuttles that are mainly utilized for university campus
intelligent transportation systems and presents initial results of ongoing work
on developing solutions to the localization and perception challenges of a
university planned pilot deployment orientated application. The paper treats
autonomous driving with real time kinematics GPS (Global Positioning Systems)
with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), combined with simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) with threedimensional light detection and
ranging (LIDAR) sensor, which provides solutions to scenarios where GPS is not
available or a lower cost and hence lower accuracy GPS is desirable. The
in-house automated low speed electric vehicle from the Automated Driving Lab is
used in experimental evaluation and verification. An improved version of Hector
SLAM was implemented on ROS and compared with high resolution GPS aided
localization framework in the same hardware architecture. The overall
configuration that combines ROS with DSpace controller can be easily
transplantable prototype in other hardware architectures for future similar
research. Real-world experiments that are reported here have been conducted in
a small test area close to the Ohio State University AV pilot test route. are

"CARLOS: An Open, Modular, and Scalable Simulation Framework for the
  Development and Testing of Software for C-ITS","Future mobility systems and their components are increasingly defined by
their software. The complexity of these cooperative intelligent transport
systems (C-ITS) and the everchanging requirements posed at the software require
continual software updates. The dynamic nature of the system and the
practically innumerable scenarios in which different software components work
together necessitate efficient and automated development and testing procedures
that use simulations as one core methodology. The availability of such
simulation architectures is a common interest among many stakeholders,
especially in the field of automated driving. That is why we propose CARLOS -
an open, modular, and scalable simulation framework for the development and
testing of software in C-ITS that leverages the rich CARLA and ROS ecosystems.
We provide core building blocks for this framework and explain how it can be
used and extended by the community. Its architecture builds upon modern
microservice and DevOps principles such as containerization and continuous
integration. In our paper, we motivate the architecture by describing important
design principles and showcasing three major use cases - software prototyping,
data-driven development, and automated testing. We make CARLOS and example

"RHINO-VR Experience: Teaching Mobile Robotics Concepts in an Interactive
  Museum Exhibit","In 1997, the very first tour guide robot RHINO was deployed in a museum in
Germany. With the ability to navigate autonomously through the environment, the
robot gave tours to over 2,000 visitors. Today, RHINO itself has become an
exhibit and is no longer operational. In this paper, we present RHINO-VR, an
interactive museum exhibit using virtual reality (VR) that allows museum
visitors to experience the historical robot RHINO in operation in a virtual
museum. RHINO-VR, unlike static exhibits, enables users to familiarize
themselves with basic mobile robotics concepts without the fear of damaging the
exhibit. In the virtual environment, the user is able to interact with RHINO in
VR by pointing to a location to which the robot should navigate and observing
the corresponding actions of the robot. To include other visitors who cannot
use the VR, we provide an external observation view to make RHINO visible to
them. We evaluated our system by measuring the frame rate of the VR simulation,
comparing the generated virtual 3D models with the originals, and conducting a
user study. The user-study showed that RHINO-VR improved the visitors'
understanding of the robot's functionality and that they would recommend
experiencing the VR exhibit to others.","Erik Schlachhoff, Nils Dengler, Leif Van Holland, Patrick Stotko, Jorge de Heuvel, Reinhard Klein, Maren Bennewitz",2024-03-22T12:07:03Z,2024-06-10T13:22:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15151v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15151v2.pdf,all:ROS AND all:mobile AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
"Magnetic polarons beyond linear spin-wave theory: Mesons dressed by
  magnons","When a mobile hole is doped into an antiferromagnet, its movement will
distort the surrounding magnetic order and yield a magnetic polaron. The
resulting complex interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom gives rise to
very rich physics and is widely believed to be at the heart of high-temperature
superconductivity in cuprates. In this paper, we develop a quantitative
theoretical formalism, based on the phenomenological parton description, to
describe magnetic polarons in the strong coupling regime. We construct an
effective Hamiltonian with weak coupling to the spin-wave excitations in the
background, making the use of standard polaronic methods possible. Our starting
point is a single hole doped into an AFM described by a 'geometric string'
capturing the strongly correlated hopping processes of charge and spin degrees
of freedom, beyond linear spin-wave approximation. Subsequently, we introduce
magnon excitations through a generalized 1/S expansion and derive an effective
coupling of these spin-waves to the hole plus the string (the meson) to arrive
at an effective polaron Hamiltonian with density-density type interactions.
After making a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation, this system is solved using
the self-consistent Born approximation to extract the renormalized polaron
properties. We apply our formalism (i) to calculate beyond linear spin-wave
ARPES spectra, (ii) to reveal the interplay of ro-vibrational meson
excitations, and (ii) to analyze the pseudogap expected at low doping.
Moreover, our work paves the way for exploring magnetic polarons out-of
equilibrium or in frustrated systems, where weak-coupling approaches are
desirable and going beyond linear spin-wave theory becomes necessary.","Pit Bermes, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt",2024-01-31T19:14:17Z,2024-01-31T19:14:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00130v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00130v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:mobile AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
SHViT: Single-Head Vision Transformer with Memory Efficient Macro Design,"Recently, efficient Vision Transformers have shown great performance with low
latency on resource-constrained devices. Conventionally, they use 4x4 patch
embeddings and a 4-stage structure at the macro level, while utilizing
sophisticated attention with multi-head configuration at the micro level. This
paper aims to address computational redundancy at all design levels in a
memory-efficient manner. We discover that using larger-stride patchify stem not
only reduces memory access costs but also achieves competitive performance by
leveraging token representations with reduced spatial redundancy from the early
stages. Furthermore, our preliminary analyses suggest that attention layers in
the early stages can be substituted with convolutions, and several attention
heads in the latter stages are computationally redundant. To handle this, we
introduce a single-head attention module that inherently prevents head
redundancy and simultaneously boosts accuracy by parallelly combining global
and local information. Building upon our solutions, we introduce SHViT, a
Single-Head Vision Transformer that obtains the state-of-the-art speed-accuracy
tradeoff. For example, on ImageNet-1k, our SHViT-S4 is 3.3x, 8.1x, and 2.4x
faster than MobileViTv2 x1.0 on GPU, CPU, and iPhone12 mobile device,
respectively, while being 1.3% more accurate. For object detection and instance
segmentation on MS COCO using Mask-RCNN head, our model achieves performance
comparable to FastViT-SA12 while exhibiting 3.8x and 2.0x lower backbone
latency on GPU and mobile device, respectively.","Seokju Yun, Youngmin Ro",2024-01-29T09:12:23Z,2024-03-27T04:14:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16456v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16456v2.pdf,all:ROS AND all:mobile AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
"The Otbot project: Dynamic modelling, parameter identification, and
  motion control of an omnidirectional tire-wheeled robot","In recent years, autonomous mobile platforms are finding an increasing range
of applications in inspection or surveillance tasks, or to the transport of
objects, in places such as smart warehouses, factories or hospitals. In these
environments it is useful for the robot to have omnidirectional capability in
the plane, so it can navigate through narrow or cluttered areas, or make
position and orientation changes without having to maneuver. While this
capability is usually achieved with directional sliding wheels, this work
studies a particular robot that achieves omnidirectionality using conventional
wheels, which are easier to manufacture and maintain, and support larger loads
in general. This robot, which we call ``Otbot'' (for omnidirectional
tire-wheeled robot), was already conceived in the late 1990s, but all the
controllers that have been proposed for it are based on purely kinematic models
so far. These controllers may be sufficient if the robot is light, or if its
motors are powerful, but on platforms that have to carry large loads, or that
have more limited motors, it is necessary to resort to control laws based on
dynamic models if the full acceleration capacities are to be exploited. This
work develops a dynamic model of Otbot, proposes a plausible methodology to
identify its parameters, and designs a control law that, using this model, is
able to track prescribed trajectories in an accurate and robust manner.","Pere Giró, Enric Celaya, Lluís Ros",2023-11-17T19:31:32Z,2023-11-17T19:31:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10834v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10834v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:mobile AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2023
"Privacy Perceptions in Robot-Assisted Well-Being Coaching: Examining the
  Roles of Information Transparency, User Control, and Proactivity","Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.","Atikkhan Faridkhan Nilgar, Manuel Dietrich, Kristof Van Laerhoven",2025-09-04T16:19:24Z,2025-09-04T16:19:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04358v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04358v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025

examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving

non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or

"Context-Aware Risk Estimation in Home Environments: A Probabilistic
  Framework for Service Robots","We present a novel framework for estimating accident-prone regions in
everyday indoor scenes, aimed at improving real-time risk awareness in service
robots operating in human-centric environments. As robots become integrated
into daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond
to environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and
effective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and
context through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is
represented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates
asymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity
and accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards
even when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for
interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on
a dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection
accuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human
perception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These
results underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance
robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared
human-robot spaces. This framework could serve as a foundation for future
systems that make context-driven safety decisions, provide real-time alerts, or
autonomously assist users in avoiding or mitigating hazards within home

the ROS bridge, allowing real-time communication between perception, decision,

"A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking
  through Differential Flatness","As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming
increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing
path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.
The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory
planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves
maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,
particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based
rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above
challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time
efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance
framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned
trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal
smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the
proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path
adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to
maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility
of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time
efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other
iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the
proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,
demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.","Zhouheng Li, Lei Xie, Cheng Hu, Hongye Su",2025-08-23T14:36:48Z,2025-08-23T14:36:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17038v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025

"Take That for Me: Multimodal Exophora Resolution with Interactive
  Questioning for Ambiguous Out-of-View Instructions","Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or

resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic

GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal

Toward an Interaction-Centered Approach to Robot Trustworthiness,"As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.","Carlo Mazzola, Hassan Ali, Kristína Malinovská, Igor Farkaš",2025-08-19T16:13:33Z,2025-08-19T16:13:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13976v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13976v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025

trajectory every five milliseconds for an autonomous vehicle. A kinematic and a
dynamic bicycle model are compared, with the dynamic model exhibiting superior
accuracy at higher speeds. Vehicle parameters such as mass, center of gravity,
moment of inertia, and cornering stiffness are determined experimentally. For
cornering stiffness, a novel measurement procedure using optical position
tracking is introduced. The model is incorporated into an extended Kalman

robot in two different public settings: 1) Student services center; 2) Refugees

"Utilizing Vision-Language Models as Action Models for Intent Recognition
  and Assistance","Human-robot collaboration requires robots to quickly infer user intent,
provide transparent reasoning, and assist users in achieving their goals. Our
recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and
manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model
(VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that
filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline
(YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance
segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their
relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object
labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing
navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant
targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a
threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the
desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in
the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using
a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.","Cesar Alan Contreras, Manolis Chiou, Alireza Rastegarpanah, Michal Szulik, Rustam Stolkin",2025-08-14T22:19:09Z,2025-08-14T22:19:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11093v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11093v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Observations of atypical users from a pilot deployment of a public-space
  social robot in a church","Though a goal of HRI is the natural integration of social robots into
everyday public spaces, real-world studies still occur mostly within controlled
environments with predetermined participants. True public spaces present an
environment which is largely unconstrained and unpredictable, frequented by a
diverse range of people whose goals can often conflict with those of the robot.
When combined with the general unfamiliarity most people have with social
robots, this leads to unexpected human-robot interactions in these public
spaces that are rarely discussed or detected in other contexts. In this paper,
we describe atypical users we observed interacting with our robot, and those
who did not, during a three-day pilot deployment within a large working church
and visitor attraction. We then discuss theoretical future advances in the
field that could address these challenges, as well as immediate practical
mitigations and strategies to help improve public space human-robot
interactions in the present. This work contributes empirical insights into the
dynamics of human-robot interaction in public environments and offers
actionable guidance for more effective future deployments for social robot

"AZRA: Extending the Affective Capabilities of Zoomorphic Robots using
  Augmented Reality","Zoomorphic robots could serve as accessible and practical alternatives for
users unable or unwilling to keep pets. However, their affective interactions
are often simplistic and short-lived, limiting their potential for domestic
adoption. In order to facilitate more dynamic and nuanced affective
interactions and relationships between users and zoomorphic robots we present
AZRA, a novel augmented reality (AR) framework that extends the affective
capabilities of these robots without physical modifications. To demonstrate
AZRA, we augment a zoomorphic robot, Petit Qoobo, with novel emotional displays
(face, light, sound, thought bubbles) and interaction modalities (voice, touch,
proximity, gaze). Additionally, AZRA features a computational model of emotion
to calculate the robot's emotional responses, daily moods, evolving personality
and needs. We highlight how AZRA can be used for rapid participatory
prototyping and enhancing existing robots, then discuss implications on future
zoomorphic robot development.","Shaun Macdonald, Salma ElSayed, Mark McGill",2025-08-11T22:39:13Z,2025-08-11T22:39:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08507v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08507v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"On the causality between affective impact and coordinated human-robot
  reactions","In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.","Morten Roed Frederiksen, Kasper Støy",2025-08-06T19:24:04Z,2025-08-06T19:24:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04834v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04834v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Towards Multimodal Social Conversations with Robots: Using
  Vision-Language Models","Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry

interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual

"Gaze-supported Large Language Model Framework for Bi-directional
  Human-Robot Interaction","The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) creates an exciting
potential for flexible, general knowledge-driven Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
systems for assistive robots. Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress
in interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot
task solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware
support of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive
robot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision
inputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to
be modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is
capable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and
fast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple
public dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved
robustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the
performance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted
HRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances
adaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics
but may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for
more straightforward tasks.","Jens V. Rüppel, Andrey Rudenko, Tim Schreiter, Martin Magnusson, Achim J.

"Integrating Perceptions: A Human-Centered Physical Safety Model for
  Human-Robot Interaction","Ensuring safety in human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential to foster user
trust and enable the broader adoption of robotic systems. Traditional safety
models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and
velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to
capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits
and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized
general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety
by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety
measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety
perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a
simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot
behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively
captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses,
trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types.
Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot
behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly
enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of
user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models.
Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated
exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role,
emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These
findings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models
that integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway
toward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.","Pranav Pandey, Ramviyas Parasuraman, Prashant Doshi",2025-07-09T09:47:05Z,2025-07-09T09:47:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06700v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06700v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
Image-driven Robot Drawing with Rapid Lognormal Movements,"Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable
rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that
can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the
intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually
executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important
for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and
more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that
bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like
motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use
the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that
enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG)
renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible
trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a
minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation
and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.","Daniel Berio, Guillaume Clivaz, Michael Stroh, Oliver Deussen, Réjean Plamondon, Sylvain Calinon, Frederic Fol Leymarie",2025-07-03T20:51:27Z,2025-07-03T20:51:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03166v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03166v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
Personalised Explanations in Long-term Human-Robot Interactions,"In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable

personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and

based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen

deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's

when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user

content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our

Online Human Action Detection during Escorting,"The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.","Siddhartha Mondal, Avik Mitra, Chayan Sarkar",2025-06-30T07:25:31Z,2025-06-30T07:25:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23573v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23573v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
Bootstrapping Human-Like Planning via LLMs,"Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.","David Porfirio, Vincent Hsiao, Morgan Fine-Morris, Leslie Smith, Laura M. Hiatt",2025-06-27T20:00:51Z,2025-06-27T20:00:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22604v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22604v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025

"Why Robots Are Bad at Detecting Their Mistakes: Limitations of
  Miscommunication Detection in Human-Robot Dialogue","Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.","Ruben Janssens, Jens De Bock, Sofie Labat, Eva Verhelst, Veronique Hoste, Tony Belpaeme",2025-06-25T09:25:04Z,2025-06-25T09:25:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20268v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20268v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
Mirror Eyes: Explainable Human-Robot Interaction at a Glance,"The gaze of a person tends to reflect their interest. This work explores what
happens when this statement is taken literally and applied to robots. Here we
present a robot system that employs a moving robot head with a screen-based eye
model that can direct the robot's gaze to points in physical space and present
a reflection-like mirror image of the attended region on top of each eye. We
conducted a user study with 33 participants, who were asked to instruct the
robot to perform pick-and-place tasks, monitor the robot's task execution, and
interrupt it in case of erroneous actions. Despite a deliberate lack of
instructions about the role of the eyes and a very brief system exposure,
participants felt more aware about the robot's information processing, detected
erroneous actions earlier, and rated the user experience higher when eye-based
mirroring was enabled compared to non-reflective eyes. These results suggest a
beneficial and intuitive utilization of the introduced method in cooperative
human-robot interaction.","Matti Krüger, Daniel Tanneberg, Chao Wang, Stephan Hasler, Michael Gienger",2025-06-23T10:06:26Z,2025-06-23T10:06:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18466v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18466v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Optimizing Exploration with a New Uncertainty Framework for Active SLAM
  Systems","Accurate reconstruction of the environment is a central goal of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. However, the agent's trajectory can
significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper presents a new method to
model map uncertainty in Active SLAM systems using an Uncertainty Map (UM). The
UM uses probability distributions to capture where the map is uncertain,
allowing Uncertainty Frontiers (UF) to be defined as key
exploration-exploitation objectives and potential stopping criteria. In
addition, the method introduces the Signed Relative Entropy (SiREn), based on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to measure both coverage and uncertainty
together. This helps balance exploration and exploitation through an
easy-to-understand parameter. Unlike methods that depend on particular SLAM
setups, the proposed approach is compatible with different types of sensors,
such as cameras, LiDARs, and multi-sensor fusion. It also addresses common
problems in exploration planning and stopping conditions. Furthermore,
integrating this map modeling approach with a UF-based planning system enables
the agent to autonomously explore open spaces, a behavior not previously
observed in the Active SLAM literature. Code and implementation details are
available as a ROS node, and all generated data are openly available for public
use, facilitating broader adoption and validation of the proposed approach.","Sebastian Sansoni, Javier Gimenez, Gastón Castro, Santiago Tosetti, Flavio Craparo",2025-06-21T18:12:41Z,2025-06-21T18:12:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17775v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17775v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
See What I Mean? Expressiveness and Clarity in Robot Display Design,"Nonverbal visual symbols and displays play an important role in communication
when humans and robots work collaboratively. However, few studies have
investigated how different types of non-verbal cues affect objective task
performance, especially in a dynamic environment that requires real time
decision-making. In this work, we designed a collaborative navigation task
where the user and the robot only had partial information about the map on each
end and thus the users were forced to communicate with a robot to complete the
task. We conducted our study in a public space and recruited 37 participants
who randomly passed by our setup. Each participant collaborated with a robot
utilizing either animated anthropomorphic eyes and animated icons, or static
anthropomorphic eyes and static icons. We found that participants that
interacted with a robot with animated displays reported the greatest level of
trust and satisfaction; that participants interpreted static icons the best;
and that participants with a robot with static eyes had the highest completion
success. These results suggest that while animation can foster trust with
robots, human-robot communication can be optimized by the addition of familiar
static icons that may be easier for users to interpret. We published our code,
designed symbols, and collected results online at:

"Conversations with Andrea: Visitors' Opinions on Android Robots in a
  Museum","The android robot Andrea was set up at a public museum in Germany for six
consecutive days to have conversations with visitors, fully autonomously. No
specific context was given, so visitors could state their opinions regarding
possible use-cases in structured interviews, without any bias. Additionally the
44 interviewees were asked for their general opinions of the robot, their
reasons (not) to interact with it and necessary improvements for future use.
The android's voice and wig were changed between different days of operation to
give varying cues regarding its gender. This did not have a significant impact
on the positive overall perception of the robot. Most visitors want the robot
to provide information about exhibits in the future, while opinions on other
roles, like a receptionist, were both wanted and explicitly not wanted by
different visitors. Speaking more languages (than only English) and faster
response times were the improvements most desired. These findings from the
interviews are in line with an analysis of the system logs, which revealed,
that after chitchat and personal questions, most of the 4436 collected requests
asked for information related to the museum and to converse in a different
language. The valuable insights gained from these real-world interactions are
now used to improve the system to become a useful real-world application.","Marcel Heisler, Christian Becker-Asano",2025-06-18T15:30:20Z,2025-06-18T15:30:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22466v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22466v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
I Know You're Listening: Adaptive Voice for HRI,"While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there
remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language
teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe
consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We
address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.
We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a
fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an
expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can
run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found
this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods
of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a
robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices
in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy
and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate
and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an
English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known
linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used
a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use
duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax
(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly
influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an ""L2 clarity mode"" for
Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels
unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and
encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these
challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.",Paige Tuttösí,2025-06-18T03:23:41Z,2025-07-30T07:40:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15107v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15107v2.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
EmojiVoice: Towards long-term controllable expressivity in robot speech,"Humans vary their expressivity when speaking for extended periods to maintain
engagement with their listener. Although social robots tend to be deployed with
``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human
speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the
expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on
robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS)
toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive
speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained
control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS
backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a
scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3)
an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied
emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long
period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the
assistant use case.","Paige Tuttösí, Shivam Mehta, Zachary Syvenky, Bermet Burkanova, Gustav Eje Henter, Angelica Lim",2025-06-18T02:49:50Z,2025-07-30T12:12:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15085v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15085v2.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Help or Hindrance: Understanding the Impact of Robot Communication in
  Action Teams","The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has recognized the importance of
enabling robots to interact with teams. Human teams rely on effective
communication for successful collaboration in time-sensitive environments.
Robots can play a role in enhancing team coordination through real-time
assistance. Despite significant progress in human-robot teaming research, there
remains an essential gap in how robots can effectively communicate with action
teams using multimodal interaction cues in time-sensitive environments. This
study addresses this knowledge gap in an experimental in-lab study to
investigate how multimodal robot communication in action teams affects workload
and human perception of robots. We explore team collaboration in a medical
training scenario where a robotic crash cart (RCC) provides verbal and
non-verbal cues to help users remember to perform iterative tasks and search
for supplies. Our findings show that verbal cues for object search tasks and
visual cues for task reminders reduce team workload and increase perceived ease
of use and perceived usefulness more effectively than a robot with no feedback.
Our work contributes to multimodal interaction research in the HRI field,
highlighting the need for more human-robot teaming research to understand best
practices for integrating collaborative robots in time-sensitive environments
such as in hospitals, search and rescue, and manufacturing applications.","Tauhid Tanjim, Jonathan St. George, Kevin Ching, Angelique Taylor",2025-06-10T15:19:26Z,2025-06-24T07:33:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08892v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08892v3.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Human-Robot Teaming Field Deployments: A Comparison Between Verbal and
  Non-verbal Communication","Healthcare workers (HCWs) encounter challenges in hospitals, such as
retrieving medical supplies quickly from crash carts, which could potentially
result in medical errors and delays in patient care. Robotic crash carts (RCCs)
have shown promise in assisting healthcare teams during medical tasks through
guided object searches and task reminders. Limited exploration has been done to
determine what communication modalities are most effective and least disruptive
to patient care in real-world settings. To address this gap, we conducted a
between-subjects experiment comparing the RCC's verbal and non-verbal
communication of object search with a standard crash cart in resuscitation
scenarios to understand the impact of robot communication on workload and
attitudes toward using robots in the workplace. Our findings indicate that
verbal communication significantly reduced mental demand and effort compared to
visual cues and with a traditional crash cart. Although frustration levels were
slightly higher during collaborations with the robot compared to a traditional
cart, these research insights provide valuable implications for human-robot
teamwork in high-stakes environments.","Tauhid Tanjim, Promise Ekpo, Huajie Cao, Jonathan St. George, Kevin Ching, Hee Rin Lee, Angelique Taylor",2025-06-10T15:17:33Z,2025-06-24T07:24:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08890v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08890v2.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Blending Participatory Design and Artificial Awareness for Trustworthy
  Autonomous Vehicles","Current robotic agents, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and drones, need to
deal with uncertain real-world environments with appropriate situational
awareness (SA), risk awareness, coordination, and decision-making. The SymAware
project strives to address this issue by designing an architecture for
artificial awareness in multi-agent systems, enabling safe collaboration of
autonomous vehicles and drones. However, these agents will also need to
interact with human users (drivers, pedestrians, drone operators), which in
turn requires an understanding of how to model the human in the interaction
scenario, and how to foster trust and transparency between the agent and the
human.
  In this work, we aim to create a data-driven model of a human driver to be
integrated into our SA architecture, grounding our research in the principles
of trustworthy human-agent interaction. To collect the data necessary for
creating the model, we conducted a large-scale user-centered study on human-AV
interaction, in which we investigate the interaction between the AV's
transparency and the users' behavior.
  The contributions of this paper are twofold: First, we illustrate in detail
our human-AV study and its findings, and second we present the resulting Markov
chain models of the human driver computed from the study's data. Our results

"Employing Laban Shape for Generating Emotionally and Functionally
  Expressive Trajectories in Robotic Manipulators","Successful human-robot collaboration depends on cohesive communication and a
precise understanding of the robot's abilities, goals, and constraints. While
robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they
exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's
intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In
this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable
robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity,
where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the
likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel
variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also
enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories
(Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape.
The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study,
where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot
competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as
distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum,
corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.","Srikrishna Bangalore Raghu, Clare Lohrmann, Akshay Bakshi, Jennifer Kim, Jose Caraveo Herrera, Bradley Hayes, Alessandro Roncone",2025-05-16T21:58:19Z,2025-06-23T18:03:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11716v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11716v2.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025

"Work in Progress: Middleware-Transparent Callback Enforcement in

such as ROS 2 systems on Linux, has been studied under nested scheduling: OS
thread scheduling and middleware layer scheduling (e.g., ROS 2 Executor).
However, by establishing a persistent one-to-one correspondence between
callbacks and OS threads, we can ignore the middleware layer and directly apply
OS scheduling parameters (e.g., scheduling policy, priority, and affinity) to
individual callbacks. We propose a middleware model that enables this idea and
implements CallbackIsolatedExecutor as a novel ROS 2 Executor. We demonstrate
that the costs (user-kernel switches, context switches, and memory usage) of
CallbackIsolatedExecutor remain lower than those of the MultiThreadedExecutor,
regardless of the number of callbacks. Additionally, the cost of
CallbackIsolatedExecutor relative to SingleThreadedExecutor stays within a
fixed ratio (1.4x for inter-process and 5x for intra-process communication).

LLM-Land: Large Language Models for Context-Aware Drone Landing,"Autonomous landing is essential for drones deployed in emergency deliveries,
post-disaster response, and other large-scale missions. By enabling
self-docking on charging platforms, it facilitates continuous operation and
significantly extends mission endurance. However, traditional approaches often
fall short in dynamic, unstructured environments due to limited semantic
awareness and reliance on fixed, context-insensitive safety margins. To address
these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates large language
model (LLMs) with model predictive control (MPC). Our approach begins with a
vision-language encoder (VLE) (e.g., BLIP), which transforms real-time images
into concise textual scene descriptions. These descriptions are processed by a
lightweight LLM (e.g., Qwen 2.5 1.5B or LLaMA 3.2 1B) equipped with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to classify scene elements and infer
context-aware safety buffers, such as 3 meters for pedestrians and 5 meters for
vehicles. The resulting semantic flags and unsafe regions are then fed into an
MPC module, enabling real-time trajectory replanning that avoids collisions
while maintaining high landing precision. We validate our framework in the
ROS-Gazebo simulator, where it consistently outperforms conventional
vision-based MPC baselines. Our results show a significant reduction in
near-miss incidents with dynamic obstacles, while preserving accurate landings
in cluttered environments.","Siwei Cai, Yuwei Wu, Lifeng Zhou",2025-05-09T19:55:22Z,2025-05-09T19:55:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06399v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06399v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
Oh F**k! How Do People Feel about Robots that Leverage Profanity?,"Profanity is nearly as old as language itself, and cursing has become
particularly ubiquitous within the last century. At the same time, robots in
personal and service applications are often overly polite, even though past
work demonstrates the potential benefits of robot norm-breaking. Thus, we
became curious about robots using curse words in error scenarios as a means for
improving social perceptions by human users. We investigated this idea using
three phases of exploratory work: an online video-based study (N = 76) with a
student pool, an online video-based study (N = 98) in the general U.S.
population, and an in-person proof-of-concept deployment (N = 52) in a campus
space, each of which included the following conditions: no-speech,
non-expletive error response, and expletive error response. A surprising result
in the outcomes for all three studies was that although verbal acknowledgment
of an error was typically beneficial (as expected based on prior work), few
significant differences appeared between the non-expletive and expletive error
acknowledgment conditions (counter to our expectations). Within the cultural
context of our work, the U.S., it seems that many users would likely not mind
if robots curse, and may even find it relatable and humorous. This work signals
a promising and mischievous design space that challenges typical robot

including disaggregated by crash type.
  Eleven crash type groups were identified from commonly relied upon crash
typologies that are derived from human crash databases. Human benchmarks were
aligned to the same vehicle types, road types, and locations as where the Waymo
Driver operated. Waymo crashes were extracted from the NHTSA Standing General

outcomes were examined because they represented previously established,
safety-relevant benchmarks where statistical testing could be performed at the
current mileage.
  Data was examined over 56.7 million RO miles through the end of January 2025,
resulting in a statistically significant lower crashed vehicle rate for all
crashes compared to the benchmarks in Any-Injury-Reported and Airbag

is displayed on the screen while it is being verbally responded to by the vocal
assistant. Although very rarely, this feature also exists on some ""social""
robots which transcribe human interactants' speech on a screen or a tablet. We
argue that this informational configuration is pragmatically consequential on
the interaction, both for human participants and for the embodied
conversational agent. Based on a corpus of co-present interactions with a
humanoid robot, we attempt to show that this transcript is a contextual feature
which can heavily impact the actions ascribed by humans to the robot: that is,
the way in which humans respond to the robot's behavior as constituting a
specific type of action (rather than another) and as constituting an adequate
response to their own previous turn.","Damien Rudaz, Christian Licoppe",2025-04-06T13:44:47Z,2025-04-06T13:44:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04488v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04488v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Estimating Scene Flow in Robot Surroundings with Distributed
  Miniaturized Time-of-Flight Sensors","Tracking motions of humans or objects in the surroundings of the robot is
essential to improve safe robot motions and reactions. In this work, we present
an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds
acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the
robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and
applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with
additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and
low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification
to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal
strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is
validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the
velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental
results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the
motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.","Jack Sander, Giammarco Caroleo, Alessandro Albini, Perla Maiolino",2025-04-03T09:57:51Z,2025-07-31T09:50:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02439v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02439v2.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
Toward Anxiety-Reducing Pocket Robots for Children,"A common denominator for most therapy treatments for children who suffer from
an anxiety disorder is daily practice routines to learn techniques needed to
overcome anxiety. However, applying those techniques while experiencing anxiety
can be highly challenging. This paper presents the design, implementation, and
pilot study of a tactile hand-held pocket robot AffectaPocket, designed to work
alongside therapy as a focus object to facilitate coping during an anxiety
attack. The robot does not require daily practice to be used, has a small form
factor, and has been designed for children 7 to 12 years old. The pocket robot
works by sensing when it is being held and attempts to shift the child's focus
by presenting them with a simple three-note rhythm-matching game. We conducted
a pilot study of the pocket robot involving four children aged 7 to 10 years,
and then a main study with 18 children aged 6 to 8 years; neither study
involved children with anxiety. Both studies aimed to assess the reliability of
the robot's sensor configuration, its design, and the effectiveness of the user
tutorial. The results indicate that the morphology and sensor setup performed
adequately and the tutorial process enabled the children to use the robot with
little practice. This work demonstrates that the presented pocket robot could
represent a step toward developing low-cost accessible technologies to help
children suffering from anxiety disorders.","Morten Roed Frederiksen, Kasper Støy, Maja Matarić",2025-03-31T13:05:59Z,2025-03-31T13:05:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24041v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24041v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for
  Socially-Aware Robot Navigation","Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under
uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them.
Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can
naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social
navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others,
inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP),
where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of
Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based
reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the
challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a
perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on

holds significant promise for enhancing the perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles, allowing them to overcome occlusions and extend their
field of view. However, existing research predominantly relies on simulated

V2X cooperative perception especially for intermediate fusion in real-world

synchronized ROS bags and provides 25,028 test frames with 6,850 annotated key
frames in challenging urban scenarios. By enabling real-time assessments of
perception accuracy and communication lantency under dynamic conditions,
V2X-ReaLO sets a new benchmark for advancing and optimizing cooperative

Ro-To-Go! Robust Reactive Control with Signal Temporal Logic,"Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness is a common objective for optimal
robot control, but its dependence on history limits the robot's decision-making
capabilities when used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches. In this
work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new
quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix
trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric
Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix
trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the
objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently
evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC

"Generating Physically Realistic and Directable Human Motions from
  Multi-Modal Inputs","This work focuses on generating realistic, physically-based human behaviors
from multi-modal inputs, which may only partially specify the desired motion.
For example, the input may come from a VR controller providing arm motion and
body velocity, partial key-point animation, computer vision applied to videos,
or even higher-level motion goals. This requires a versatile low-level humanoid
controller that can handle such sparse, under-specified guidance, seamlessly
switch between skills, and recover from failures. Current approaches for
learning humanoid controllers from demonstration data capture some of these
characteristics, but none achieve them all. To this end, we introduce the
Masked Humanoid Controller (MHC), a novel approach that applies multi-objective
imitation learning on augmented and selectively masked motion demonstrations.
The training methodology results in an MHC that exhibits the key capabilities
of catch-up to out-of-sync input commands, combining elements from multiple
motion sequences, and completing unspecified parts of motions from sparse
multimodal input. We demonstrate these key capabilities for an MHC learned over
a dataset of 87 diverse skills and showcase different multi-modal use cases,
including integration with planning frameworks to highlight MHC's ability to
solve new user-defined tasks without any finetuning.","Aayam Shrestha, Pan Liu, German Ros, Kai Yuan, Alan Fern",2025-02-08T17:02:11Z,2025-02-08T17:02:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05641v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05641v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2025
"Reduce Lap Time for Autonomous Racing with Curvature-Integrated MPCC
  Local Trajectory Planning Method","The widespread application of autonomous driving technology has significantly
advanced the field of autonomous racing. Model Predictive Contouring Control
(MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous
racing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that
have significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle
during autonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a
curvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for
autonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory
based on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation
involves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference
velocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for
optimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference velocity
profile is created by normalizing and mapping the curvature of the racetrack
centerline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local
trajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed
CiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing
vehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack
with sharp curvature, improving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to
other autonomous racing trajectory planning methods. Our code is available at

"Multi-LiCa: A Motion and Targetless Multi LiDAR-to-LiDAR Calibration
  Framework","Today's autonomous vehicles rely on a multitude of sensors to perceive their

novel approach for the alignment, e.g. calibration. We present an automatic
motion- and targetless approach for the extrinsic multi LiDAR-to-LiDAR
calibration without the need for additional sensor modalities or an initial
transformation input. We propose a two-step process with feature-based matching
for the coarse alignment and a GICP-based fine registration in combination with
a cost-based matching strategy. Our approach can be applied to any number of
sensors and positions if there is a partial overlap between the field of view
of single sensors. We show that our pipeline is better generalized to different
sensor setups and scenarios and is on par or better in calibration accuracy
than existing approaches. The presented framework is integrated in ROS 2 but
can also be used as a standalone application. To build upon our work, our

EVOLVE: Emotion and Visual Output Learning via LLM Evaluation,"Human acceptance of social robots is greatly effected by empathy and

various input data from the user. While systems such as this can become

LLM-selected actions and emotional expressions can help reinforce the realism
of displayed empathy and allow for improved communication between the robot and
user. Beyond portraying empathy in spoken or written responses, this shows the
possibilities of using LLMs in actuated, real world scenarios. In this work we
extend research in LLM-driven nonverbal behavior for social robots by
considering more open-ended emotional response selection leveraging new

"Unified Understanding of Environment, Task, and Human for Human-Robot
  Interaction in Real-World Environments","To facilitate human--robot interaction (HRI) tasks in real-world scenarios,
service robots must adapt to dynamic environments and understand the required
tasks while effectively communicating with humans. To accomplish HRI in
practice, we propose a novel indoor dynamic map, task understanding system, and
response generation system. The indoor dynamic map optimizes robot behavior by
managing an occupancy grid map and dynamic information, such as furniture and
humans, in separate layers. The task understanding system targets tasks that
require multiple actions, such as serving ordered items. Task representations
that predefine the flow of necessary actions are applied to achieve highly
accurate understanding. The response generation system is executed in parallel
with task understanding to facilitate smooth HRI by informing humans of the
subsequent actions of the robot. In this study, we focused on waiter duties in
a restaurant setting as a representative application of HRI in a dynamic
environment. We developed an HRI system that could perform tasks such as
serving food and cleaning up while communicating with customers. In experiments
conducted in a simulated restaurant environment, the proposed HRI system
successfully communicated with customers and served ordered food with 90\%
accuracy. In a questionnaire administered after the experiment, the HRI system
of the robot received 4.2 points out of 5. These outcomes indicated the

equivalent functionality. We compare trajectories generated by different
approaches in the 2D simulator and evaluate performance across various belief

"VECTOR: Velocity-Enhanced GRU Neural Network for Real-Time 3D UAV
  Trajectory Prediction","This paper tackles the challenge of real-time 3D trajectory prediction for
UAVs, which is critical for applications such as aerial surveillance and
defense. Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data
struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position
domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity
estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance
prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this
gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units
(GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that
rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and
positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is
designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges
faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology
employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide
range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated
using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from
the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models
significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square
error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the
effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV
trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and
out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000

"Leveraging Augmented Reality for Improved Situational Awareness During

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly pivotal. These missions
require seamless, real-time communication among diverse roles within response
teams, particularly between Remote Operators (ROs) and On-Site Operators

visualization, suffers from noise, and requires mental effort to interpret
information, leading to miscommunications and misunderstandings. To address
these challenges, this paper presents VizCom-AR, an Augmented Reality system

"What Am I? Evaluating the Effect of Language Fluency and Task Competency

people in various human-social environments (HSEs). In many of these
environments, the perception of the robot often depends on its capabilities,
e.g., task competency, language fluency, etc. To enable fluent human-robot
interaction (HRI) in HSEs, it is crucial to understand the impact of these
capabilities on the perception of the robot. Although many works have
investigated the effects of various robot capabilities on the robot's
perception separately, in this paper, we present a large-scale HRI study (n =
60) to investigate the combined impact of both language fluency and task
competency on the perception of a robot. The results suggest that while
language fluency may play a more significant role than task competency in the
perception of the verbal competency of a robot, both language fluency and task
competency contribute to the perception of the intelligence and reliability of
the robot. The results also indicate that task competency may play a more
significant role than language fluency in the perception of meeting

"Dynamic Benchmarks: Spatial and Temporal Alignment for ADS Performance
  Evaluation","Deployed SAE level 4+ Automated Driving Systems (ADS) without a human driver
are currently operational ride-hailing fleets on surface streets in the United
States. This current use case and future applications of this technology will
determine where and when the fleets operate, potentially resulting in a

constructing dynamic human benchmarks that adjust for spatial and temporal
variations in driving distribution between an ADS and the overall human driven
fleet. Dynamic benchmarks were generated using human police-reported crash
data, human vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data, and over 20 million miles of
Waymo's rider-only (RO) operational data accumulated across three US counties.
The spatial adjustment revealed significant differences across various severity
levels in adjusted crash rates compared to unadjusted benchmarks with these
differences ranging from 10% to 47% higher in San Francisco, 12% to 20% higher
in Maricopa, and 7% lower to 34% higher in Los Angeles counties. The
time-of-day adjustment in San Francisco, limited to this region due to data
availability, resulted in adjusted crash rates 2% lower to 16% higher than
unadjusted rates, depending on severity level. The findings underscore the
importance of adjusting for spatial and temporal confounders in benchmarking
analysis, which ultimately contributes to a more equitable benchmark for ADS
performance evaluations.","Yin-Hsiu Chen, John M. Scanlon, Kristofer D. Kusano, Timothy L.

"Soothing Sensations: Enhancing Interactions with a Socially Assistive
  Robot through Vibrotactile Heartbeats","Physical interactions with socially assistive robots (SARs) positively affect
user wellbeing. However, haptic experiences when touching a SAR are typically
limited to perceiving the robot's movements or shell texture, while other
modalities that could enhance the touch experience with the robot, such as
vibrotactile stimulation, are under-explored. In this exploratory qualitative
study, we investigate the potential of enhancing human interaction with the
PARO robot through vibrotactile heartbeats, with the goal to regulate
subjective wellbeing during stressful situations. We conducted in-depth
one-on-one interviews with 30 participants, who watched three horror movie
clips alone, with PARO, and with a PARO that displayed a vibrotactile
heartbeat. Our findings show that PARO's presence and its interactive
capabilities can help users regulate emotions through attentional redeployment
from a stressor toward the robot. The vibrotactile heartbeat further reinforced
PARO's physical and social presence, enhancing the socio-emotional support
provided by the robot and its perceived life-likeness. We discuss the impact of
individual differences in user experience and implications for the future
design of life-like vibrotactile stimulation for SARs.","Jacqueline Borgstedt, Shaun Macdonald, Karola Marky, Frank E. Pollick, Stephen A.

"Custom Non-Linear Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance in
  Indoor and Outdoor Environments","Navigating complex environments requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and
autonomous systems to perform trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in
real-time. While many control strategies have effectively utilized linear
approximations, addressing the non-linear dynamics of UAV, especially in
obstacle-dense environments, remains a key challenge that requires further
research. This paper introduces a Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
framework for the DJI Matrice 100, addressing these challenges by using a
dynamic model and B-spline interpolation for smooth reference trajectories,
ensuring minimal deviation while respecting safety constraints. The framework
supports various trajectory types and employs a penalty-based cost function for
control accuracy in tight maneuvers. The framework utilizes CasADi for
efficient real-time optimization, enabling the UAV to maintain robust operation
even under tight computational constraints. Simulation and real-world indoor
and outdoor experiments demonstrated the NMPC ability to adapt to disturbances,
resulting in smooth, collision-free navigation.","Lara Laban, Mariusz Wzorek, Piotr Rudol, Tommy Persson",2024-10-03T17:50:19Z,2024-10-03T17:50:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02732v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02732v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
Precise Workcell Sketching from Point Clouds Using an AR Toolbox,"Capturing real-world 3D spaces as point clouds is efficient and descriptive,
but it comes with sensor errors and lacks object parametrization. These
limitations render point clouds unsuitable for various real-world applications,
such as robot programming, without extensive post-processing (e.g., outlier
removal, semantic segmentation). On the other hand, CAD modeling provides
high-quality, parametric representations of 3D space with embedded semantic
data, but requires manual component creation that is time-consuming and costly.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Our method for 3D workcell sketching from point
clouds allows users to refine raw point clouds using an Augmented Reality (AR)
interface that leverages their knowledge and the real-world 3D environment. By
utilizing a toolbox and an AR-enabled pointing device, users can enhance point
cloud accuracy based on the device's position in 3D space. We validate our
approach by comparing it with ground truth models, demonstrating that it
achieves a mean error within 1cm - significant improvement over standard LiDAR
scanner apps.","Krzysztof Zieliński, Bruce Blumberg, Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard",2024-10-01T08:07:51Z,2024-10-01T08:07:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00479v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00479v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
"A Model-Agnostic Approach for Semantically Driven Disambiguation in
  Human-Robot Interaction","Ambiguities are inevitable in human-robot interaction, especially when a
robot follows user instructions in a large, shared space. For example, if a
user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified
instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing
factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining
room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the
presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have
assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have
predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail
for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these
gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically
driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects
in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding
models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification
method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment
evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different
custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications
improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first
attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available at

"Towards No-Code Programming of Cobots: Experiments with Code Synthesis
  by Large Code Models for Conversational Programming","While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in household
environments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found on
shop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there.
``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assembly
lines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to make
changes, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs.
To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs),
and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for
conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the
``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation
for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer'
instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be
built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We
create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions
(human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With
this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for
synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a
simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate
`first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing
`higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).","Chalamalasetti Kranti, Sherzod Hakimov, David Schlangen",2024-09-17T10:04:50Z,2025-08-18T15:35:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11041v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11041v3.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
"A HeARTfelt Robot: Social Robot-Driven Deep Emotional Art Reflection
  with Children","Social-emotional learning (SEL) skills are essential for children to develop
to provide a foundation for future relational and academic success. Using art
as a medium for creation or as a topic to provoke conversation is a well-known
method of SEL learning. Similarly, social robots have been used to teach SEL
competencies like empathy, but the combination of art and social robotics has
been minimally explored. In this paper, we present a novel child-robot
interaction designed to foster empathy and promote SEL competencies via a
conversation about art scaffolded by a social robot. Participants (N=11, age
range: 7-11) conversed with a social robot about emotional and neutral art.
Analysis of video and speech data demonstrated that this interaction design
successfully engaged children in the practice of SEL skills, like emotion
recognition and self-awareness, and greater rates of empathetic reasoning were
observed when children engaged with the robot about emotional art. This study
demonstrated that art-based reflection with a social robot, particularly on
emotional art, can foster empathy in children, and interactions with a social
robot help alleviate discomfort when sharing deep or vulnerable emotions.","Isabella Pu, Golda Nguyen, Lama Alsultan, Rosalind Picard, Cynthia Breazeal, Sharifa Alghowinem",2024-09-16T20:29:20Z,2024-09-16T20:29:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10710v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10710v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024

"Do Mistakes Matter? Comparing Trust Responses of Different Age Groups to
  Errors Made by Physically Assistive Robots","Trust is a key factor in ensuring acceptable human-robot interaction,
especially in settings where robots may be assisting with critical activities
of daily living. When practically deployed, robots are bound to make occasional
mistakes, yet the degree to which these errors will impact a care recipient's
trust in the robot, especially in performing physically assistive tasks,
remains an open question. To investigate this, we conducted experiments where
participants interacted with physically assistive robots which would
occasionally make intentional mistakes while performing two different tasks:
bathing and feeding. Our study considered the error response of two
populations: younger adults at a university (median age 26) and older adults at
an independent living facility (median age 83). We observed that the impact of
errors on a users' trust in the robot depends on both their age and the task
that the robot is performing. We also found that older adults tend to evaluate
the robot on factors unrelated to the robot's performance, making their trust
in the system more resilient to errors when compared to younger adults. Code
and supplementary materials are available on our project webpage.","Sasha Wald, Kavya Puthuveetil, Zackory Erickson",2024-08-23T15:23:56Z,2024-08-23T15:23:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13153v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13153v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
Control-Theoretic Analysis of Shared Control Systems,"Users of shared control systems change their behavior in the presence of
assistance, which conflicts with assumpts about user behavior that some
assistance methods make. In this paper, we propose an analysis technique to
evaluate the user's experience with the assistive systems that bypasses
required assumptions: we model the assistance as a dynamical system that can be
analyzed using control theory techniques. We analyze the shared autonomy
assistance algorithm and make several observations: we identify a problem with
runaway goal confidence and propose a system adjustment to mitigate it, we
demonstrate that the system inherently limits the possible actions available to
the user, and we show that in a simplified setting, the effect of the
assistance is to drive the system to the convex hull of the goals and, once
there, add a layer of indirection between the user control and the system
behavior. We conclude by discussing the possible uses of this analysis for the
field.","Reuben M. Aronson, Elaine Schaertl Short",2024-08-22T03:34:06Z,2024-08-22T03:34:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12103v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
Bidirectional Intent Communication: A Role for Large Foundation Models,"Integrating multimodal foundation models has significantly enhanced

enhances the interactive experience by incorporating multimodal inputs like
speech and user gaze dynamics. Furthermore, Bident supports verbal utterances

"Toward a Dialogue System Using a Large Language Model to Recognize User

operations using voice interaction, and dialogue functions using agents. In the
offline environment, multimodal dialogue functions are also being realized,
such as guidance by Artificial Intelligence agents (AI agents) using tablet

on the part of the AI agent or for recognizing them using textual or voice
information of the user's utterances, but methods for AI agents to recognize
emotions from the user's facial expressions have not been studied. In this
study, we examined whether or not LLM-based AI agents can interact with users
according to their emotional states by capturing the user in dialogue with a

"Eyes on the Game: Deciphering Implicit Human Signals to Infer Human
  Proficiency, Trust, and Intent","Effective collaboration between humans and AIs hinges on transparent
communication and alignment of mental models. However, explicit, verbal
communication is not always feasible. Under such circumstances, human-human
teams often depend on implicit, nonverbal cues to glean important information
about their teammates such as intent and expertise, thereby bolstering team
alignment and adaptability. Among these implicit cues, two of the most salient
and fundamental are a human's actions in the environment and their visual
attention. In this paper, we present a novel method to combine eye gaze data
and behavioral data, and evaluate their respective predictive power for human
proficiency, trust, and intent. We first collect a dataset of paired eye gaze
and gameplay data in the fast-paced collaborative ""Overcooked"" environment. We
then train models on this dataset to compare how the predictive powers differ
between gaze data, gameplay data, and their combination. We additionally
compare our method to prior works that aggregate eye gaze data and demonstrate
how these aggregation methods can substantially reduce the predictive ability
of eye gaze. Our results indicate that, while eye gaze data and gameplay data
excel in different situations, a model that integrates both types consistently
outperforms all baselines. This work paves the way for developing intuitive and

to fit individual preferences for 25 different subjects. Our results show that
this is an effective strategy, with 76% of users feeling happy with their
identified optimal handshake parameters, and 20% feeling neutral. Moreover,
compared with random and test handshakes, the optimized handshakes have
significantly decreased errors in amplitude and frequency, lower Dynamic Time

Recently, radars have shown the potential to improve the accuracy and

environmental conditions such as adverse weather and low-light scenarios. In
this paper, we present a framework for ego-velocity estimation, which we call
RAVE, that relies on 3D automotive radar data and encompasses zero velocity
detection, outlier rejection, and velocity estimation. In addition, we propose
a simple filtering method to discard infeasible ego-velocity estimates. We also
conduct a systematic analysis of how different existing outlier rejection
techniques and optimization loss functions impact estimation accuracy. Our
evaluation on three open-source datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the

"Imagining In-distribution States: How Predictable Robot Behavior Can
  Enable User Control Over Learned Policies","It is crucial that users are empowered to take advantage of the functionality
of a robot and use their understanding of that functionality to perform novel
and creative tasks. Given a robot trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
user may wish to leverage that autonomy along with their familiarity of how
they expect the robot to behave to collaborate with the robot. One technique is
for the user to take control of some of the robot's action space through
teleoperation, allowing the RL policy to simultaneously control the rest. We
formalize this type of shared control as Partitioned Control (PC). However,
this may not be possible using an out-of-the-box RL policy. For example, a
user's control may bring the robot into a failure state from the policy's
perspective, causing it to act unexpectedly and hindering the success of the
user's desired task. In this work, we formalize this problem and present
Imaginary Out-of-Distribution Actions, IODA, an initial algorithm which
empowers users to leverage their expectations of a robot's behavior to
accomplish new tasks. We deploy IODA in a user study with a real robot and find
that IODA leads to both better task performance and a higher degree of
alignment between robot behavior and user expectation. We also show that in PC,
there is a strong and significant correlation between task performance and the
robot's ability to meet user expectations, highlighting the need for approaches

I2EDL: Interactive Instruction Error Detection and Localization,"In the Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
task, the human user guides an autonomous agent to reach a target goal via a
series of low-level actions following a textual instruction in natural
language. However, most existing methods do not address the likely case where
users may make mistakes when providing such instruction (e.g. ""turn left""
instead of ""turn right""). In this work, we address a novel task of Interactive
VLN in Continuous Environments (IVLN-CE), which allows the agent to interact
with the user during the VLN-CE navigation to verify any doubts regarding the
instruction errors. We propose an Interactive Instruction Error Detector and
Localizer (I2EDL) that triggers the user-agent interaction upon the detection
of instruction errors during the navigation. We leverage a pre-trained module
to detect instruction errors and pinpoint them in the instruction by
cross-referencing the textual input and past observations. In such way, the
agent is able to query the user for a timely correction, without demanding the

"A Robust Filter for Marker-less Multi-person Tracking in Human-Robot
  Interaction Scenarios","Pursuing natural and marker-less human-robot interaction (HRI) has been a
long-standing robotics research focus, driven by the vision of seamless
collaboration without physical markers. Marker-less approaches promise an
improved user experience, but state-of-the-art struggles with the challenges
posed by intrinsic errors in human pose estimation (HPE) and depth cameras.
These errors can lead to issues such as robot jittering, which can
significantly impact the trust users have in collaborative systems. We propose
a filtering pipeline that refines incomplete 3D human poses from an HPE
backbone and a single RGB-D camera to address these challenges, solving for
occlusions that can degrade the interaction. Experimental results show that
using the proposed filter leads to more consistent and noise-free motion
representation, reducing unexpected robot movements and enabling smoother
interaction.","Enrico Martini, Harshil Parekh, Shaoting Peng, Nicola Bombieri, Nadia Figueroa",2024-06-03T22:59:53Z,2024-06-03T22:59:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01832v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01832v1.pdf,all:ROS AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024

Reward-Punishment Reinforcement Learning with Maximum Entropy,"We introduce the ``soft Deep MaxPain'' (softDMP) algorithm, which integrates
the optimization of long-term policy entropy into reward-punishment
reinforcement learning objectives. Our motivation is to facilitate a smoother
variation of operators utilized in the updating of action values beyond
traditional ``max'' and ``min'' operators, where the goal is enhancing sample
efficiency and robustness. We also address two unresolved issues from the
previous Deep MaxPain method. Firstly, we investigate how the negated
(``flipped'') pain-seeking sub-policy, derived from the punishment action
value, collaborates with the ``min'' operator to effectively learn the
punishment module and how softDMP's smooth learning operator provides insights
into the ``flipping'' trick. Secondly, we tackle the challenge of data
collection for learning the punishment module to mitigate inconsistencies
arising from the involvement of the ``flipped'' sub-policy (pain-avoidance
sub-policy) in the unified behavior policy. We empirically explore the first
issue in two discrete Markov Decision Process (MDP) environments, elucidating
the crucial advancements of the DMP approach and the necessity for soft
treatments on the hard operators. For the second issue, we propose a
probabilistic classifier based on the ratio of the pain-seeking sub-policy to
the sum of the pain-seeking and goal-reaching sub-policies. This classifier
assigns roll-outs to separate replay buffers for updating reward and punishment
action-value functions, respectively. Our framework demonstrates superior
performance in Turtlebot 3's maze navigation tasks under the ROS Gazebo

Fast LiDAR Upsampling using Conditional Diffusion Models,"The search for refining 3D LiDAR data has attracted growing interest
motivated by recent techniques such as supervised learning or generative
model-based methods. Existing approaches have shown the possibilities for using
diffusion models to generate refined LiDAR data with high fidelity, although
the performance and speed of such methods have been limited. These limitations
make it difficult to execute in real-time, causing the approaches to struggle
in real-world tasks such as autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on conditional diffusion
models for fast and high-quality sparse-to-dense upsampling of 3D scene point
clouds through an image representation. Our method employs denoising diffusion
probabilistic models trained with conditional inpainting masks, which have been
shown to give high performance on image completion tasks. We introduce a series
of experiments, including multiple datasets, sampling steps, and conditional
masks. This paper illustrates that our method outperforms the baselines in
sampling speed and quality on upsampling tasks using the KITTI-360 dataset.

Learning Social Navigation from Demonstrations with Deep Neural Networks,"Traditional path-planning techniques treat humans as obstacles. This has
changed since robots started to enter human environments. On modern robots,
social navigation has become an important aspect of navigation systems. To use
learning-based techniques to achieve social navigation, a powerful framework
that is capable of representing complex functions with as few data as possible
is required. In this study, we benefited from recent advances in deep learning
at both global and local planning levels to achieve human-aware navigation on a
simulated robot. Two distinct deep models are trained with respective
objectives: one for global planning and one for local planning. These models
are then employed in the simulated robot. In the end, it has been shown that
our model can successfully carry out both global and local planning tasks. We
have shown that our system could generate paths that successfully reach targets

propose employing an adapted Temporal Graph Networks to comprehensively
represent social interaction dynamics while enabling its practical

including gaze interaction, voice activity and environmental context. This
representation of social interaction dynamics is trained as a link prediction
problem using annotated gaze interaction data. The F1-score outperformed the

next speaker prediction which achieves an improvement of 29.0%. Our
contributions are two-fold, including a model to representing social
interaction dynamics which can be used for many downstream human-robot

"Changing human's impression of empathy from agent by verbalizing agent's

empathy and trust between people and agents are becoming increasingly
important. A better understanding of agents by people will help to improve the
problems caused by the future use of agents in society. In the past, there has
been a focus on the importance of self-disclosure and the relationship between
agents and humans in their interactions. In this study, we focused on the
attributes of self-disclosure and the relationship between agents and people.
An experiment was conducted to investigate hypotheses on trust and empathy with
agents through six attributes of self-disclosure (opinions and attitudes,
hobbies, work, money, personality, and body) and through competitive and
cooperative relationships before a robotic agent performs a joint task. The
experiment consisted of two between-participant factors: six levels of
self-disclosure attributes and two levels of relationship with the agent. The
results showed that the two factors had no effect on trust in the agent, but
there was statistical significance for the attribute of self-disclosure
regarding a person's empathy toward the agent. In addition, statistical
significance was found regarding the agent's ability to empathize with a person
as perceived by the person only in the case where the type of relationship,
competitive or cooperative, was presented. The results of this study could lead
to an effective method for building relationships with agents, which are

for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system

"RF-Source Seeking with Obstacle Avoidance using Real-time Modified
  Artificial Potential Fields in Unknown Environments","Navigation of UAVs in unknown environments with obstacles is essential for
applications in disaster response and infrastructure monitoring. However,
existing obstacle avoidance algorithms, such as Artificial Potential Field
(APF) are unable to generalize across environments with different obstacle
configurations. Furthermore, the precise location of the final target may not
be available in applications such as search and rescue, in which case
approaches such as RF source seeking can be used to align towards the target
location. This paper proposes a real-time trajectory planning method, which
involves real-time adaptation of APF through a sampling-based approach. The
proposed approach utilizes only the bearing angle of the target without its
precise location, and adjusts the potential field parameters according to the
environment with new obstacle configurations in real time. The main
contributions of the article are i) an RF source seeking algorithm to provide a
bearing angle estimate using RF signal calculations based on antenna placement,
and ii) a modified APF for adaptable collision avoidance in changing
environments, which are evaluated separately in the simulation software Gazebo,
using ROS2 for communication. Simulation results show that the RF
source-seeking algorithm achieves high accuracy, with an average angular error
of just 1.48 degrees, and with this estimate, the proposed navigation algorithm

  surfaces and some defense mechanisms. However, due to escalating regulations
  imposed by aviation authorities on security research on real UAVs, and the
  substantial costs associated with hardware test-bed configurations, there
  arises a necessity for a simulator capable of substituting for hardware
  experiments, and/or narrowing down their scope to the strictly necessary.
  The study of different attack mechanisms requires specific features in a
  simulator. We propose a simulation framework based on ROS2, leveraging some
  of its key advantages, including modularity, replicability, customization,
  and the utilization of open-source tools such as Gazebo. Our framework has a
  built-in motion planner, controller, communication models and attack models.
  We share examples of research use cases that our framework can enable,
  demonstrating its utility.","Unmesh Patil, Akshith Gunasekaran, Rakesh Bobba, Houssam Abbas",2024-10-04T23:23:54Z,2024-10-04T23:23:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03971v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03971v1.pdf,all:ROS2 AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
Newton-Raphson Flow for Aggressive Quadrotor Tracking Control,"We apply the Newton-Raphson flow tracking controller to aggressive quadrotor
flight and demonstrate that it achieves good tracking performance over a suite
of benchmark trajectories, beating the native trajectory tracking controller in
the popular PX4 Autopilot. The Newton-Raphson flow tracking controller is a
recently proposed integrator-type controller that aims to drive to zero the
error between a future predicted system output and the reference trajectory.
This controller is computationally lightweight, requiring only an imprecise
predictor, and achieves guaranteed asymptotic error bounds under certain
conditions. We show that these theoretical advantages are realizable on a
quadrotor hardware platform. Our experiments are conducted on a Holybrox x500v2
quadrotor using a Pixhawk 6x flight controller and a Rasbperry Pi 4 companion
computer which receives location information from an OptiTrack motion capture
system and sends input commands through the ROS2 API for the PX4 software
stack.","Evanns Morales-Cuadrado, Christian Llanes, Yorai Wardi, Samuel Coogan",2024-08-20T21:11:38Z,2024-08-20T21:11:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11197v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11197v1.pdf,all:ROS2 AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
"VIPS-Odom: Visual-Inertial Odometry Tightly-coupled with Parking Slots
  for Autonomous Parking","Precise localization is of great importance for autonomous parking task since
it provides service for the downstream planning and control modules, which
significantly affects the system performance. For parking scenarios, dynamic
lighting, sparse textures, and the instability of global positioning system
(GPS) signals pose challenges for most traditional localization methods. To
address these difficulties, we propose VIPS-Odom, a novel semantic
visual-inertial odometry framework for underground autonomous parking, which
adopts tightly-coupled optimization to fuse measurements from multi-modal
sensors and solves odometry. Our VIPS-Odom integrates parking slots detected
from the synthesized bird-eye-view (BEV) image with traditional feature points
in the frontend, and conducts tightly-coupled optimization with joint
constraints introduced by measurements from the inertial measurement unit,
wheel speed sensor and parking slots in the backend. We develop a multi-object
tracking framework to robustly track parking slots' states. To prove the
superiority of our method, we equip an electronic vehicle with related sensors
and build an experimental platform based on ROS2 system. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our method compared with other
baselines for parking scenarios.","Xuefeng Jiang, Fangyuan Wang, Rongzhang Zheng, Han Liu, Yixiong Huo, Jinzhang Peng, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum",2024-07-06T09:21:25Z,2024-07-06T09:21:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05017v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05017v1.pdf,all:ROS2 AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
"Hybrid Force Motion Control with Estimated Surface Normal for
  Manufacturing Applications","This paper proposes a hybrid force-motion framework that utilizes real-time
surface normal updates. The surface normal is estimated via a novel method that
leverages force sensing measurements and velocity commands to compensate the
friction bias. This approach is critical for robust execution of precision
force-controlled tasks in manufacturing, such as thermoplastic tape replacement
that traces surfaces or paths on a workpiece subject to uncertainties deviated
from the model. We formulated the proposed method and implemented the framework
in ROS2 environment. The approach was validated using kinematic simulations and
a hardware platform. Specifically, we demonstrated the approach on a 7-DoF
manipulator equipped with a force/torque sensor at the end-effector.","Ehsan Nasiri, Long Wang",2024-04-05T21:38:38Z,2024-04-05T21:38:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04419v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04419v1.pdf,all:ROS2 AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
"GarchingSim: An Autonomous Driving Simulator with Photorealistic Scenes
  and Minimalist Workflow","Conducting real road testing for autonomous driving algorithms can be
expensive and sometimes impractical, particularly for small startups and
research institutes. Thus, simulation becomes an important method for
evaluating these algorithms. However, the availability of free and open-source
simulators is limited, and the installation and configuration process can be
daunting for beginners and interdisciplinary researchers. We introduce an
autonomous driving simulator with photorealistic scenes, meanwhile keeping a
user-friendly workflow. The simulator is able to communicate with external
algorithms through ROS2 or Socket.IO, making it compatible with existing
software stacks. Furthermore, we implement a highly accurate vehicle dynamics
model within the simulator to enhance the realism of the vehicle's physical
effects. The simulator is able to serve various functions, including generating
synthetic data and driving with machine learning-based algorithms. Moreover, we
prioritize simplicity in the deployment process, ensuring that beginners find
it approachable and user-friendly.","Liguo Zhou, Yinglei Song, Yichao Gao, Zhou Yu, Michael Sodamin, Hongshen Liu, Liang Ma, Lian Liu, Hao Liu, Yang Liu, Haichuan Li, Guang Chen, Alois Knoll",2024-01-28T23:26:15Z,2024-01-30T15:57:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15803v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15803v2.pdf,all:ROS2 AND all:robot AND submittedDate:[202309062229 TO 202509052229],2024
