# robotics_research_trends

This is a hack project to explore trends in robotics research.

The worflow is generally:

1. Choose an area of interest
2. Scrape papers
3. Download PDFS
4. Analyze papers

For analysis I am currently considering word maps, geographic maps of papers, comparing use of clearpath platforms versus others, comparing different types and sizes of platforms

The target conclusion would be to determine ideal research platform type, size and features.
